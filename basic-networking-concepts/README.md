- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A MAN is a larger than LAN but smaller than WAN. 

- **Campus Area Network (CAN)**: CAN is bigger than LAN but smaller than MAN.

Those are the common types of networks but there are some other types of network as well like, SAN, POLAN, EPN, VPN, HAN.

All this network can be wired or wireless. If those networks are wireless then called it WPAN, WLAN, WWAM, WMAN, WCAN.
